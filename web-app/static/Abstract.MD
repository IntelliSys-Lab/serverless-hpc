Serverless FaaS (Function as a Service) provides zero wait times, fault tolerant execution of scientific workloads 
that include popular data processing, classification and computer vision libraries. Both opensource and commercial clouds have
been leveraging FaaS capabilities to power microservices and distributed application deployments on cloud. With the experimental
analysis performed in this project through cloud deployments on Apache Openwhisk and Amazon Web Services (AWS), we gain an
insight into real time performance of scientific workloads and their white box behavior in serverless environments. We also
simulate a traditional parallel computing architecture that is used in containerized deployments on classical high-performance
applications.
