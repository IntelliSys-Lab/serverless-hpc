High Performance computing power cannot be available everywhere all the time. However, we should be able to utilize the power available on demand and not pay for the time that any service is not used. 

In order to showcase the ability of serverless computing to compute challenging workloads anywhere we chose to perform an
experiment with a raspberry PI with minimum configurations. 

We aim to deploy tensorflow machine learning in this limited 1GB capable raspberry PI. 

We setup the raspberry pi as follows:
